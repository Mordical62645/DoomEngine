DOOM

Doom was distributesd using a SHAREWARE model. 
    SHAREWARE is a type of proprietary software 
    that is initially shared by the owner for trial
    use at little to no cost.

DOOM.WAD/DOOM1.WAD - this is where the game assets is. 
    That is the only thing we need to recreate Doom
    using python

STRUCTURE:
DoomEngine/
│
├── wad/
│   └── DOOM1.WAD
│
├── main.py             # contains the wad file path
├── wad_data.py         # this will have access to the instance of the engine.  
└── wad_reader.py       # open the wad file for reading in binary mode  

REQUIREMENTS:
IDE: VSCode
Python 3.13.3
Pygame (wrapper for C language SDL library)
Numba
Slade3 for checking WAD contents

A WAD file always starts with a 12-byte header (Ion know what the fuck that is tho)

To get the header, we will need to read 12 bytes.
    First 4 bytes are ASCII characters indicating the type of WAD file.
    2 signed integers of 4 bytes each necessary to get the file directory in which
    we will get access to all file assets

Getting the header will tell us the initial content of the WAD: 
    {'wad_type': 'IWAD', 'lump_count': 1264, 'init_offset': 4175796}

We can directly check for assets file contents by using Slade3 editor.

Let's start with getting the vertex data: 'VERTEXES'
    2D x and y coordinates of the map
    these two coordinates are 16 bit signed integers
    so we need a method to read 2 bytes as 16 bit numbers
    we will also have to implement a method to read 8 bit numbers
